This Italian-style brew is known for its rich flavor, intense aroma, and a creamy foam on top called \"crema.\" Unlike regular coffee, which uses slower brewing methods, espresso is brewed quickly under pressure, resulting in a strong, small shot that forms the base for drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. Originating in Italy in the early 1900s, espresso has become a cornerstone of coffee culture worldwide."

Green coffee beans, which are raw and grassy, turn brown and aromatic during roasting due to chemical changes like caramelization. Coffee is roasted in specialized machines that carefully control time and temperature. The level of roast (light, medium, or dark) depends on how long the beans are roasted. Light roasts are roasted briefly, yielding a milder taste with more acidity. Medium roasts offer a balanced flavor, while dark roasts are roasted longer for a deeper, bolder taste with less acidity. Roasting is key to the final flavor of coffee. Coffee roasters use precise controls to achieve the desired roast level without burning or under-roasting the beans. Each roast type has a unique flavor profile, allowing for a range of coffee tastes."

Unlike blade grinders, which chop beans into varying sizes, burr grinders crush beans between two abrasive surfaces to achieve an even grind. Espresso needs a fine grind because it brews under high pressure. Consistently fine grounds ensure a smooth extraction and a rich shot with crema.
